# EMR-System
This project is aims to create CRUD APIs for Electronic Medical Record management system.

In this repo I have created the restful api using nodejs, express and mysql for health records management system.

## MySQL configuration
Please create database by running DB/emr_final.sql and make the changes in the config/db.config.js file.

In the project directory, you can run:

>npm install

This will install the dependencies inside node_modules

>node server.js OR nodemon start OR npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in the browser.

## Testing
For testing purpose, I have included Restful Apis collection in Test folder.

## Documents
Project related documents are stored here.
